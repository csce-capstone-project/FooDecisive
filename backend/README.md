# Getting Started with the Flask App
Make sure you have python3 installed on your machine.

First navigate to the backend directory by typing `cd backend`

## Available Scripts

Create a python environment in the backend directory:

### `pipenv shell`

Install the dependencies that I have installed and included in requirements.txt:

### `pipenv install -r requirements.txt`

Runs the server in development mode:

### `python3 app.py`

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

Now pull up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
in different tabs to view the frontend page and server, respectively.
